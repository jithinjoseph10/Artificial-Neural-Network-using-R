# Parametric Analysis of Fused Deposition Modelling of Nylon6 with Prediction &amp; Validation of Tensile Strength using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Additive Manufacturing offers great geometric flexibility and can produce custom parts and
prototypes quickly at low cost and low wastage of material. Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is
one type of additive manufacturing process, where the product is manufactured by extruding
thermoplastic filaments through a heated nozzle, melting the material, and applying the plastic layer
by layer to a build platform. The process parameters affect the design, quality, functionality, and
mechanical properties of the final part. The present article discusses the effects of infill density, layer
height, print speed and raster angle on tensile strength of FDM components made of Nylon 6. Full
factorial orthogonal array is used to print samples in the ASTM D638-14 standard and the effect of
input parameters on tensile strength is studied. An Artificial neural network (ANN) is developed to
predict the tensile strength with varying input parameters. The trained ANN model is validated by
conducting confirmation experiments and the errors were found to be acceptable. The developed
model can be useful for the prediction of parameters for the production of end use products.
